# Space-School-2023-2024

This repository contains the content for the 2023/2024 Space School year.

**Goal**

The goal of Space School is to provide new members of QSAT with a fun learning environment to develop the necessary skills and knowledge to be an effective member of the team, bridging the gap to working on the complex satellite subsystems. If you complete Space School, which encompasses completing the labs in this repository and attending the weekly Space School meetings, you will create a toast satellite (toastSat). Your toastSat will be launched on a high-altitude balloon in the winter. The skills gained here are the basis for what you will need to know when you are working on the team's 3U cube satellite. üõ∞Ô∏è

Please note that you require NO PREVIOUS KNOWLEDGE, and we are here to support you on your entire toastSat building journey.

**Skills gained**

By the end of Space School, you will gain experience in the following areas:

Technical skills

- LAUNCHING SOMETHING INTO THE STRATOSPHERE üöÄ
- Arduino
- CAD
- Soldering
- PCB's
- Experience using microcontrollers
- Experience developing basic circuits
- Working within design constraints
- Developing system budgets (mass/power/data/ etc.)

Team-based skills

- Understanding of the satellite subsystems
- Intro to space engineering
- Get to know all the amazing people we have on the team üôÇ

**Content Overview**

The week numbers correspond to the weeks of the school semester.

**Semester One - Fall**

- Week 3: Meet space school members and software setup.
- Week 4, Lab 1: Blinky LED
- Week 5, Lab 2: TMP36 sensor lab
- Fall Reading Week.
- Week 6, Lab 3: Saving and uploading data to SD card reader.
- Week 7, Lab 4: To be announced
- Week 8, Lab 5: To be announced
- Week 9, Lab 6: To be announced
- Week 10, Learn about the ToastSat project, launch, and sensors for missions. Form groups.
- Week 11, Finalize groups and missions, decide on what sensors your team will use. Intro to satellite budgets. Start learning how to work with the sensor(s).
- Week 12: Optional work session

**Semester Two - Winter**

- Weeks 1-7: Working on toastSats
- Week 7 (Tentative): Launch your completed toastSat!
- The remainder of the semester will be spent integrating all members onto a chosen sub-team.
  
**Space School History**

Many years ago in 2019 Emma Paczkowski and Sydney Caulfield had just finished their first year on QSET as a first year. Although they had spent a whole year on the team, they did not accomplish much as they had hoped, and they were sad to see the 50 first-year students that started in September diminish to only 4 at the end of the year. To help both the experience of new members on the team as well as to increase retention, the idea of Space School was born. Over the 3 years it has run, the structure has changed and improved. This can be attributed to the wonderful additions of Thomas Sears (space expert, team mentor, and phenomenal presenter), Sean Tedesco (incredible lab writer responsible and the former CTO), and Piper Steffen (2021/2022 space school organizer). We hope Space School will remain an accessible option for new members looking to bridge the gap between their knowledge and the complex subsystem projects!
